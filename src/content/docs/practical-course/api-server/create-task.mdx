    {title: 'Create tasks with the HTTP client', description: 'Add task to the list with an API call to the fake API'},
]} />

## The TaskService

You just communicated with the API server to retrieve a list of tasks.
Let's update the API server list by adding a new task.

Based on the HTTP protocol, you will use the **post** function to add a task to the list: **http.post()**.
This function expects 2 parameters:

1. The URL of the API server
2. The task to send to the server

```typescript
addTask(task: TaskForm) {
  return this.http.post<Task>('http://localhost:3000/tasks', {
      ...task,
      createdAt: new Date()
  });
}
```

As JSON-server is able to generate an **id** for us, you won't use the **uuid** package to generate an **id** for the task.

This new **addTask** function defines the contract with the API server:

- it makes a **POST** request
- it sends a **TaskForm** object as a request body
- it communicates with the API server at `http://localhost:3000/tasks`

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/task.service.ts` file.

    ```typescript ins={"Add the addTask function": 10-16}
    import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
    import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
    import { Task, TaskForm } from './task.model';

    @Injectable({
      providedIn: 'root'
    })
    export class TaskService {
      constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

      addTask(task: TaskForm) {
        return this.http.post<Task>('http://localhost:3000/tasks', {
          ...task,
          createdAt: new Date()
        });
      }
    }
    ```

</Steps>

## Update the TaskFormComponent

In the previous step, you were explained Observables need to be subscribed to in order to execute the request.
You were able to use the **async** pipe in the HTML template to subscribe to the observable.

But in the current situation, the request does happen in the component.ts file.

Let's subscribe to the observable by using the `subscribe` function.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/task-form/task-form.component.ts` file.

    ```typescript ins={"Update the submit function": 19-23} ins="this.taskService.addTask(task).subscribe();"
    import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
    import { TaskService } from '../task.service';
    import { TaskForm } from '../task.model';

    @Component({
      selector: 'app-task-form',
      templateUrl: './task-form.component.html',
      styleUrls: ['./task-form.component.css']
    })
    export class TaskFormComponent {
      task: TaskForm = {
        title: '',
        description: ''
      };

      constructor(private taskService: TaskService) { }

      submit(task: TaskForm) {
        if (task.id) {
            this.taskService.updateTask(task);
        } else {
            this.taskService.addTask(task).subscribe();
        }
        this.router.navigate(['/']);
      }
    }
    ```

</Steps>

It now works, but not exactly as you should expect...


## Asynchronous programming

Remember the newsletter example from the previous chapter?
Given that's a physical newsletter, it takes time to be delivered to your mailbox.
Some time happens between the moment you subscribe and the moment you receive the newsletter.

That's the same in our situation.
By sending a request with the **subscribe()** function, you're asking the server to add a task to the list.
But the navigation to the **"/"** route will happen immediately after the request is sent, not after the request is completed.

Let's review the code you just changed in the `submit` function of the `TaskFormComponent`:

```typescript
submit(task: TaskForm) {
    if (task.id) {
        this.taskService.updateTask(task);
    } else {
        this.taskService.addTask(task).subscribe();
    }
    this.router.navigate(['/']);
}
```

1. you call the **addTask** function from the **TaskService** to add a task to the API server.
2. you navigate to the **"/"** route.

:::danger
This code won't run in the expected order
:::

API communication is asynchronous, meaning that the action of **addTask** function might not be resolved yet when the **router.navigate** function is called.
Our server is served locally, so the request will be fast, but it's still asynchronous.

A request to the server can take a long time if the server or the network is slow for any reason.
In this situation, While the request is still being processed, the **router.navigate** function will be executed.

That's not what you want as by navigating, you want to display the updated task list.

You need to wait for the response from the server before navigating to the **"/"** route.

## The Subscription

The subscribe function accepts a callback function as a parameter.
This callback function will be executed when the observable emits a value.

Let's use this callback function to navigate to the **"/"** route.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/task-form/task-form.component.ts` file.

    ```typescript ins={"Update the submit function": 20-25}
    import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
    import { Router } from '@angular/router';
    import { TaskService } from '../task.service';
    import { TaskForm } from '../task.model';

    @Component({
      selector: 'app-task-form',
      templateUrl: './task-form.component.html',
      styleUrls: ['./task-form.component.css']
    })
    export class TaskFormComponent {
      task: TaskForm = {
        title: '',
        description: ''
      };

      constructor(private taskService: TaskService, private router: Router) { }

      submit(task: TaskForm) {
        if (task.id) {
            this.taskService.updateTask(task);
        } else {
            this.taskService.addTask(task).subscribe(() => {
              this.router.navigate(['/']);
            });
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    :::caution
    This change temporarily introduces a regression in the application.
    Updating a task does no longer trigger the router navigation.
    We'll fix it in the next lesson.

## ‚úîÔ∏è What you learned

In this chapter, you learned how to use the **HttpClient** to add a task to the list. As the API communication is asynchronous, you learned how to use the **subscribe** function to wait for the response from the server before navigating to the **"/"** route.
