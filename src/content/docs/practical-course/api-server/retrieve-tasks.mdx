## Update the TaskService

The **HttpClient** service exposes multiple functions to make HTTP requests to a server. In this chapter, we will use its **get** function to query the task list from the API server.

:::note
**get** refers to **GET** requests in the HTTP protocol.
:::

This function takes the API server endpoint as a parameter: `http://localhost:3000/tasks`.
That's the URL it'll query to get the task list.

```typescript
getTasks() {
  return this.http.get<Task[]>('http://localhost:3000/tasks');
}
```

This new **getTasks** defines the contract with the API server:

- it makes a **GET** request
- it expects an array of **Task** objects as a response
- it communicates with the API server at `http://localhost:3000/tasks` URL.

:::caution
As we are now querying the task list from the API server, the **tasks** variable is no longer needed in the **TaskService** class.
However as some code still depends on it, we will keep it for now.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/task.service.ts` file.

    ```typescript ins={"Add the getTasks function": 24-27}
    import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
    import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
    import { Task } from './task.model';

    @Injectable({
        providedIn: 'root'
    })
    export class TaskService {

        constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

        getTasks() {
            return this.http.get<Task[]>('http://localhost:3000/tasks');
        }
    }
    ```

</Steps>

## Update the TaskListComponent

Let's update the **TaskListComponent** to use this new **getTasks** function and rename the **tasks** variable to **tasks$** to reflect the fact that it is now an Observable.

```typescript
tasks$ = this.taskService.getTasks();
```

Why so? What's an Observable?

**tasks** was an array of **Task** objects. Now, **tasks$** is an Observable of an array of **Task** objects.

By calling the **getTasks** function, we get an Observable that will emit the list of tasks once received from the API server.
To differentiate a value from the observable, the Angular community commonly use the `$` suffix in Angular applications.

:::note
An Observable **observes** a stream of data.
:::

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the the `src/app/task-list/task-list.component.ts` file.

    ```typescript del={"Remove the task variable": 11-12} ins={"Replace it with the tasks$ variable": 13-14}
    import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
    import { TaskService } from '../task.service';
    import { Task } from '../task.model';

    @Component({
        selector: 'app-task-list',
        templateUrl: './task-list.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./task-list.component.css']
    })
    export class TaskListComponent {

        tasks: Task[] = this.taskService.tasks;

        tasks$ = this.taskService.getTasks();

        constructor(private taskService: TaskService) { }
    }
    ```

</Steps>

## Subscription

Calling the **getTasks** function won't trigger the API request immediately and as it's not trigger yet, the observable won't emit any value.
Let's trigger what we call a subscription to the observable to start the request.

:::tip
We **subscribe** like we would subscribe to a newspaper.
We request the last issue of the newspaper and only once it's available, it's delivered and we can read it.
:::

### How to subscribe

There are multiple ways to subscribe to an observable.
For the given situation, Let's use the **async** pipe in the HTML template.

Like the **date** pipe used earlier, the **async** pipe role is to transform the data before displaying it.
Here it's role will be to subscribe to the observable and returns the list of tasks once available.

:::tip
While there are alternatives, the **async** pipe is the recommended way to subscribe to an observable in the HTML template.
You'll discover the alternative at the end of this page.
:::

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the the `src/app/task-list/task-list.component.html` file.

    ```html ins="tasks$ | async"
    <tr *ngFor="let task of tasks$ | async">
        <td>{{ task.title }}</td>
        <td>{{ task.createdAt | date }}</td>
        <td>
            <a class="btn btn-primary" [routerLink]="['/update', task.id]">Mettre √† jour</a>
            <button class="btn btn-danger" type="button" (click)="deleteTask(task.id)">Supprimer</button>
        </td>
    </tr>
    ```

</Steps>

### Alternative

The alternative to using the **async** pipe is to subscribe to the observable in the component.

This is done by calling the **subscribe** function on the observable and passing a function as a callback parameter.
This callback will be called once the data is available.

This subscription will be used in the **ngOnInit** function of the **TaskListComponent** class.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the the `src/app/task-list/task-list.component.ts` file.

    ```typescript ins={"Subscribe to the observable": 14-17}
    import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
    import { TaskService } from '../task.service';
    import { Task } from '../task.model';

    @Component({
        selector: 'app-task-list',
        templateUrl: './task-list.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./task-list.component.css']
    })
    export class TaskListComponent implements OnInit {
        tasks: Task[] = this.taskService.tasks;

        constructor(private taskService: TaskService) { }

        ngOnInit() {
            this.taskService.getTasks().subscribe(tasks => this.tasks = tasks);
        }
    }
    ```

</Steps>

### Pitfalls

While subscribing to the observable in the component is a valid solution, it misses some optimizations that the **async** pipe provides.
It also requires more code for the same result.
