You are able to fill out the form, but you need to get the data from the form to create a new task and add it to the existing list.

## Angular Forms API

Angular provides 2 different API to work with forms:

- Template-driven forms
- Reactive forms

In this course, you will use the template-driven forms API to bind the form.

## Template-driven forms

What does **Template-driven** mean?

The form structure and validations are defined in the HTML template. The template-driven forms are easy to use and suitable for simple forms.
On Angular side, our focus is to bind each field to a property to retrieve its current value.

## TaskForm type

Let's create a **TaskForm** type to represent a task form. The **TaskForm** type will have two properties: **title** and **description**.
Its shape is different from the **Task** interface you created earlier.You'll create a new derivated one from the existing **Task** interface.

### Pick TypeScript Utility type

The **Pick** utility type allows you to create a new type by picking some properties from an existing type.
The benefit of using the **Pick** utility type is that it helps you to avoid duplicating the properties of the existing type.

You pass it the original type and the properties you want to pick.

```ts
// task.model.ts
export type TaskForm = Pick<Task, 'title' | 'description'>;

```

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Open the `src/app/task-form/task.model.ts` file.

2. Add the following code below the existing interface:

    ```typescript
    // task.model.ts
    export type TaskForm = Pick<Task, 'title' | 'description'>;
    ```

3. Update the `src/app/task-form/task-form.component.ts` file.

    ```typescript ins={"Import the new TaskForm type": 3-4} ins={"Add the task variable with empty values": 12-16}
    // task-form.component.ts
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';

    import {TaskForm} from '../model/task.model';

    @Component({
      selector: 'app-task-form',
      templateUrl: './task-form.component.html',
      styleUrls: ['./task-form.component.css']
    })
    export class TaskFormComponent {

      task: TaskForm = {
        title: '',
        description: ''
      };
      
    }
    ```

</Steps>

## Form binding

To bind a form to your new **task** variable in Angular, you can use the `[ngModel]` directive.
The `[ngModel]` directive is a built-in directive that allows you to bind a form input to a variable.
But it won't be enough for our usecase: it only allows us to bind the value of the property to the field, not to get the user input changes.

### 2 way data binding

To update our **task** variable when the form is updated, you need to use the `[(ngModel)]` format.
Also called **banana in a box** syntax to remember how to write it, it allows us to:

- bind the value of the task to the form field
- to update the value of the task based on the user input

You want to bind the **title** input to the **task.title** property and the **description** textarea to the **task.description** property.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/task-form/task-form.component.html` file.

    ```html ins={"Bind the title with the ngModel directive": 4-5} ins="[(ngModel)]="task.title"" ins={"Bind the description with the ngModel directive": 8-9} ins="[(ngModel)]="task.description""
    // task-form.component.html
    <form>
      <label for="title" class="form-label">Title</label>

      <input type="text" id="title" name="title" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="task.title">

      <label for="description" class="form-label">Description</label>

      <textarea id="description" name="description" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="task.description"></textarea>

      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Create task</button>
    </form>
    ```

</Steps>

By being bound to the form, the **task** variable will be updated when the form is updated.
